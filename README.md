# Hotel Cancellation Risk Predictor

This project contains a machine learning model and an interactive web application designed to predict the likelihood of a hotel booking being canceled.

## üéØ Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to help hotel managers mitigate revenue loss by identifying high-risk bookings proactively. By inputting key details of a new booking, the application provides an instant cancellation risk score, enabling targeted intervention strategies.

The final model is an XGBoost Classifier trained on a comprehensive hotel booking dataset, which has proven effective in identifying key drivers of cancellation.
